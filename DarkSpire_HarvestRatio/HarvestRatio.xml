  <!-- to figure out how much energy is derived by a unit dying on a Dark Spire planet,
       you multiply the Strength of unit killed by the killing faction's ration_when_killing and the
       dying unit's faction ratio_when dying. So if the Devourer kills a human ship then we multiply
       the strength of the human ship killed by the human's ratio_when_dying and the devourer's ratio_when_killing.

       We provide a Default, then allow overrides for other factions -->
