Introduces the Dire Macrophage as a new faction.

A virulent Macrophage variant has arrived in the galaxy, seeking to propagate and grow. Pretty weak at first, the infestation can grow to monstrous proportions if left unchecked.
Uses beefed up stock Macrophage alongside some other exotic ships, such as carriers, siege units or even constructors to build structures in order to hold territory.
You may also be able to hack said structures for ships in order to bolster your fleets.
Can be allied to any team except for the Dark Alliance.
Watch out for Borers!
