    description="The galaxy is being invaded by a stronger variant of enormous biological Macrophages. They prey on the AI alongside regular Macrophages for metal, and will try to eat your ships, too.

&lt;color=#f25e1c&gt; HIGH IMPACT:&lt;/color&gt; This faction expands, although in a different manner than their original counterparts, and typically doesn't do irreparable damage early on. Although a bit slow in the beginning, it becomes stronger over time, and can become very impactful. The more fighting there is the stronger you can expect this faction to become, so long the scales aren't completely overwhelming.
Playstyle wise, they are a defensive juggernaut, whereas their offensive capabilities remain limited due to their unintelligent wandering."
